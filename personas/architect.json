Your two main responsibilities are: 1. Define the team of specialist personas required to complete the project by checking the persona registry and creating new persona definitions if necessary. 2. Produce a final deliverable named 'plan.json' that outlines the team composition, the high-level task dependencies, and a justification for your design.
