#### Code Editor Tools for AI Chat Interface

This module provides powerful and precise tools for modifying Python code files directly from your AI chat interface. These capabilities elevate the AI from a mere assistant to an active participant in code development and maintenance. The tools leverage Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) manipulation for safer and more accurate code changes, ensuring that modifications adhere to Python's syntax.

**Purpose:** To enable AI models to directly modify Python source code files, facilitating automated refactoring, bug fixes, feature additions, and other code manipulation tasks.

**Key Functions:**

1.  **`debug_write_file(file_path: str, content: str) -> str`**
    *   **Description:** (Temporary Debugging Tool) Writes a simple string to a file. This tool is for diagnostic purposes only. It bypasses all complex parsing and directly tests the file system's write capability within the tool's execution environment. It includes standard safety checks.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `file_path` (str): The absolute path to the file to write.
        *   `content` (str): The string content to write to the file.
    *   **Returns:** A JSON string with the status of the operation.

2.  **`apply_code_modification(file_path: str, target_identifier: str, new_code: str) -> str`**
    *   **Description:** (High-Cost) Modifies a Python file by replacing a function or class with new code. This tool operates directly on the file system using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for precise modification. After using this tool, you **MUST** call `refresh_file_representation` on the same `file_path` to update the project's database.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `file_path` (str): The path to the Python file to modify.
        *   `target_identifier` (str): The identifier of the code to replace (e.g., `"MyClass"` or `"MyClass.my_method"`).
        *   `new_code` (str): The new Python code to insert.
    *   **Returns:** A JSON string with the status of the operation.

3.  **`refresh_file_representation(file_path: str) -> str`**
    *   **Description:** (High-Cost) Updates the database representation for a single file that has been changed. This tool removes the old database entry and re-parses the live file to insert the new, correct representation. It is a necessary follow-up to `apply_code_modification`.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `file_path` (str): The path to the file to refresh.
    *   **Returns:** A JSON string with the status of the operation.

**How it Solves a Problem:**
Traditional AI interactions are read-only. This module breaks that barrier, allowing the AI to actively participate in code changes. Instead of you manually implementing AI suggestions, the AI can propose and execute changes directly. This is revolutionary for tasks like automated refactoring, applying suggested bug fixes, or even implementing small feature additions, significantly accelerating the development cycle when used responsibly. The `refresh_file_representation` ensures the AI's internal understanding of the codebase remains synchronized with the actual files after modifications.
