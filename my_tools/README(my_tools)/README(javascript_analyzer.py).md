#### JavaScript Analyzer Tool for AI Chat Interface

This tool enables your AI models to analyze JavaScript code, specifically by listing all programming constructs or filtering for specific types like functions, classes, imports, or exports within a given JavaScript file. This capability is crucial for understanding the logic flow of a web application, identifying available functionalities, or preparing for code refactoring and debugging tasks in JavaScript projects.

**Purpose:** To provide AI models with the ability to inspect JavaScript files and enumerate their programming constructs, aiding in code comprehension and development.

**Key Function:**

*   **`list_javascript_constructs(file_path: str, construct_type: Optional[str] = None) -> str`**
    *   **Description:** Lists all programming constructs or a specific type of construct from a JavaScript file. This tool can be used to find all functions, classes, imports, or exports within a given JavaScript file.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `file_path` (string): The path to the JavaScript file to analyze. (Required)
        *   `construct_type` (string, optional): The specific type of construct to filter for. Valid types include: `'function'`, `'class'`, `'import'`, `'export'`. If omitted, all recognized constructs are returned.
    *   **Returns:** A string (JSON format) detailing the names of the JavaScript constructs found in the file.

**How it Solves a Problem:**
In larger JavaScript files or projects, quickly identifying all defined functions, classes, imports, or exports can be challenging. The `list_javascript_constructs` tool automates this process, giving the AI an immediate overview of the file's components. This is particularly useful when the AI is assisting with code reviews, suggesting where new logic might fit, understanding dependencies, or analyzing module structure within the JavaScript codebase.
