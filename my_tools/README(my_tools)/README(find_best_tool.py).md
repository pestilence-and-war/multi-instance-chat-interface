### `my_tools/find_best_tool.py`

#### Tool Searcher for AI Chat Interface

This tool allows your AI models to dynamically search for the most relevant available tool to address a user's request. Instead of hardcoding tool usage, the AI can query this tool with a natural language description of the task, and receive suggestions for which internal tool might be best suited to help. This enhances the AI's adaptability and problem-solving capabilities.

**Purpose:** To enable AI models to intelligently discover and select the most appropriate tool from the available set based on the user's query, improving tool-use efficiency and accuracy.

**Key Function:**

*   **`search_for_tool(user_query: str) -> list`**
    *   **Description:** Finds the most relevant tool to answer a user's request by semantically searching the descriptions of all available tools.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `user_query` (string): A concise description of the task to perform. (Required)
    *   **Returns:** A list of strings, where each string is the name of a relevant tool. The list is ordered by relevance.

**How it Solves a Problem:**
As the number of available tools grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an AI to know which tool to use for a given task. This `search_for_tool` function acts as a meta-tool, allowing the AI to "think" about which tool it needs. This makes the AI more autonomous and capable of handling a wider range of requests without explicit user selection for each tool-use scenario.
