#### Python Expression Evaluator Tool for AI Chat Interface

This tool provides your AI models with the ability to evaluate arbitrary Python mathematical expressions. It acts as a secure, sandboxed calculator that understands standard Python operators and can leverage functions and constants from the `math` module. This is invaluable for tasks requiring numerical computation, data manipulation, or quick calculations within a conversation.

**Purpose:** To enable AI models to perform mathematical calculations and evaluate Python expressions directly, extending their capabilities beyond symbolic reasoning.

**Key Function:**

*   **`evaluate_expression(expression: str) -> str`**
    *   **Description:** Evaluates a Python mathematical expression string using `eval()`. Supports standard Python operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`) and functions/constants available through the `math` module (e.g., `math.sqrt`, `math.sin`, `math.pi`).
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `expression` (string): The mathematical expression to evaluate, using Python syntax (e.g., `"math.sqrt(16) + 5"`, `"(2+3)*math.pi"`, `"2**8"`). (Required)
    *   **Returns:** A string representing the result of the evaluated expression.

**How it Solves a Problem:**
While AI models are excellent at generating text, they can struggle with precise mathematical calculations or complex numerical reasoning. This `evaluate_expression` tool offloads such tasks to a reliable Python interpreter, ensuring accuracy. This allows the AI to provide concrete answers to mathematical queries, perform quick unit conversions, or process numerical data that would otherwise be beyond its inherent capabilities.
