#### Tavily Search Tool for AI Chat Interface

This tool integrates the Tavily Search API directly into your AI chat environment, enabling your AI models to perform real-time web searches and retrieve up-to-date information. It's designed to overcome the AI's inherent knowledge cutoff, allowing it to access current events, statistics, or any information available on the web.

**Purpose:** To provide AI models with internet access for information retrieval, enhancing their ability to answer current queries and perform research.

**Key Function:**

*   **`tavily_search(query: str, search_depth: str = 'basic', include_answer: bool = True, max_results: int = 3, include_domains: Optional[List[str]] = None, exclude_domains: Optional[List[str]] = None, topic: str = 'general') -> str`**
    *   **Description:** Performs a search using the Tavily Search API and returns structured results. This tool is optimized for AI agents, providing concise and relevant information. It can search various topics, control the depth of the search, and optionally include a direct answer to the query if found.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `query` (string): The search query. (Required)
        *   `search_depth` (string): The depth of the search. `'basic'` for a quick search, or `'advanced'` for a more comprehensive search. (Optional, Default: `'basic'`. Enum: `basic`, `advanced`)
        *   `include_answer` (boolean): Whether to include a direct answer to the query in the search results, if available. (Optional, Default: `True`)
        *   `max_results` (integer): The maximum number of search results to return. (Optional, Default: `3`. Tavily's max is typically around 5-7 for basic and 10 for advanced, but LLMs often prefer fewer, more focused results).
        *   `include_domains` (List[string]): A list of specific domains to search within (e.g., `["wikipedia.org"]`). (Optional, Default: `None`)
        *   `exclude_domains` (List[string]): A list of specific domains to exclude from the search. (Optional, Default: `None`)
        *   `topic` (string): The topic of the search (e.g., `'general'`, `'news'`, `'research_paper'`, `'code'`). This helps Tavily focus the search. (Optional, Default: `'general'`. Enum: `general`, `news`, `finance`, `research_paper`, `code`, `sports`)
    *   **Returns:** A JSON string containing the search results.

**How it Solves a Problem:**
Without this tool, your AI is limited to its training data, which quickly becomes outdated. By integrating `tavily_search`, the AI can now answer questions about current events, verify facts, or gather information on topics that emerged after its last training update, making it a much more versatile and reliable source of information for real-time queries.
